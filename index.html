<h1>About Me</h1>
I am currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk/index.html" target="_blank">Mathematical Physics group</a> at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of
Tim Adamo (you can find a list of his publications <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1058489" target="_blank">here</a>). I did my undergraduate in physics and a masters in theoretical physics at the University of Oxford. I completed courses on 
Representation Theory, Quantum Field Theory, Supersymmetry, String Theory, Conformal Field Theory and Topological Quantum Theory. I also wrote 
a <a href="1044662.pdf" target="_blank"> dissertation </a> on the novel topic of higher generalised symmetries, under the supervision of Dr. Andrei Constantin. Linked here is my updated <a href="CV Iustin Surubaru.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
